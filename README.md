# Angular Frontend
Navigate to the Angular folder and execute **run.bat** to start the frontend test server on windows.  
You can also start the server by typing **npm start**.  
You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed to test the frontend locally.

## Mocked backend
You need a REST Api to test API calls (such as login).
